## What is this???

This is a board game that asks the user a question whenever the user selects a space on the grid. If the user answers the question correctly, the user will be able to put a x or o to the space the user selected. If the user fails to answer the question, it switch to x or o. The user will win once the user acquires 3 consecutive x or o horizontally or vertically.

## User Stories

As a User, I want to be able to:

1.  sign up
1.  sign in
1.  change password
1.  sign out
1.  have all buttons working
1.  see questions
1.  change questions
1.  create questions
1.  see no errors.

## Technologies Used

Javascript, JQuery, AJAX, Handlebars, SQL, HTML, CSS, SCSS, Bootstrap, Heroku

## Development Process

I created my wireframe as my first step. Base on the wireframe, I had to create the game logic for a board turn based game. I went and made the logic for the game. I made variables and functions. I tested the variables and functions as I made each one function successfully. After javascript, I implemented html and some css for the basic setup of the user interface. Then, I injected jQuery to make the logic interact with html. Lastly, I put in AJAX to make the browser able to acquire data from the database.

## Unsolved Problems!

1.  Make the game winnable diagonally.
1.  Have the app display how many times the user have played and how many times x or o won.
1.  Make the user interface prettier!!!!!
